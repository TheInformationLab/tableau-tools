## üîê Authentication

This tool uses **Personal Access Tokens** (PAT) for authentication. You can generate a PAT from your Tableau user settings.

- You **must** have access to all the sites you intend to export workbooks from.
- If you do not have access to the "default" site, you **must** provide the site URI of a site you do have access to. The script will still proceed using the appropriate site URIs.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Nested projects are not supported. Projects are uniquely identified using their ID and flattened into a single-level folder structure.
- Does not currently support workbook versioning or filtering by ownership/date.
